# TODO 2.4 working with variables and printing their values
print("=" * 10, "Section 2.4 printing variable values", "=" * 10)
# 1) Declare a variable named age, and set the initial value to your age
# 2) Print the variable value
# 3) Print the word age with a space and the variable value, example: age 25
# 4) Assign 42 to the age variable
# 5) Print the word age with a space and the variable value: age 42

# TODO 2.6 keyboard input

# TODO 2.6 - 2.7 numeric input, performing calculations
print("=" * 10, "Section 2.6-2.7 numeric input and calculations", "=" * 10)
# 1) Get the user to enter their age, store it as an integer. Use int() to convert a string to an integer.
# 2) Print the age in a sentence using a comma in the print statement to separate items
#    (when using a comma in a print statement, you can mix numbers and strings)
#    example: "This year you are ", age
# 3) Add 1 to the age: age = age + 1
# 4) Print the result using concatenation in the print statement:
#     Remember - when concatenating a variable that holds numbers you need to convert it to a string: str(variable)
#     example: "Next year you will be " + str(age)
